# Call On an Expert
## His Background:
* Has experience on serveral *Smart Contract* projects .
* Senior Engineer on game and web3 programming.
* He never developed on BIF.

## His Opinion:
* BIF is a variant of Solidity.
* Maybe derived from ETH algorithm.
* Workload estimate:
  - An experienced engineer develop on new chain at first time.
  - Will be less workload after first time, just like copy.

## Solidity
* Background
Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.
Example:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```
